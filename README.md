## Setup Instructions

Run a powershell prompt as admin and ensure you can run unsigned scripts

```Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser 
```

Install scoop

```PowerShell
  # https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop
  iex (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://get.scoop.sh')
```

Use scoop to install common utilities

```PowerShell
  # if you don't already have git installed 
  scoop install git    

  # pshazz for nice themable prompt, dir colors and more
  # https://github.com/lukesampson/pshazz
  scoop install pshazz 

  # install more scoop apps
  scoop install 7zip composer curl ffmpeg file gzip imagemagick less ln nano php rsync ruby sqlite sudo touch unrar unzip vim vimtutor wget which youtube-dl zip
```

Configure PowerShell profile. You may want to fork my repo so you can track your own customizations.

``` PowerShell
  # remove existing profile if it exists. WARNING: this will delete your existing profile. Backup your existing profile first if you
  # want to keep any settings that you have already made there
  if (test-path $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell) { rm -Recurse -Force $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell } 

  # Clone into the standard PowerShell profile directory
  cd $env:USERPROFILE\Documents
  git clone https://github.com/Nachtalb/WindowsPowerShell.git
```

##### IMPORTANT! Close your current PowerShell window and start a new one as admin so that the new profile settings will take effect

Setup ConEmu - Includes the color scheme you see in the screenshot.

```PowerShell
  # Clone repo with ConEmu configuration and installation script
  cd C:\
  git clone https://github.com/xpando/ConEmu.git
  cd ConEmu

  # Install fonts
  dir .\Fonts\*.ttf |% { add-font -path $_ }

  # download and unzip ConEmu binaries
  .\install.ps1
```

Now you can run **_ConEmu.exe_** or **_ConEmu64.exe_** if you are a 64bit OS and continue.

Customize pshazz theme

```PowerShell
  # download my pshazz theme shown in screenshot 
  $url = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/xpando/d42df2c0f014d710db42/raw/cce3f6ca874bd18d316bca946bda34a2bd1efe43/xpando.json'
  if (!(test-path $env:USERPROFILE\pshazz)) { md $env:USERPROFILE\pshazz}
  (new-object net.webclient).downloadstring($url) | out-file $env:USERPROFILE\pshazz\xpando.json
  pshazz use xpando
```
